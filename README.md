# Word-Guess-Game.

The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, giving the number of letters.
If the  guess is letter or number which occurs in the word, the word should be updated in all of the correct positions. 
If the suggested letter or number does not occur in the word, the game should draw or remove one element of the visual representation as a tally mark. The game is over when:

1.The player completes the word, or guesses the whole word correctly.
2.The diagram representing the tally marks is complete.
